# posts
A repository of code that I have mentioned or used on my blog: http://hpaulkeeler.com/posts/

Feel free to use any of the code for whatever purposes. If you publish a paper using any of the code, please cite this repository. 

I have written the code mostly in Python, C, and MATLAB. Much of it concerns random models.

See the individual posts for more details.
