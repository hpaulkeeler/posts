# Simulates a site percolation model on a square lattice embedded in a torus 
# by using an algorithm proposed in a paper by Newman and Ziff[1]. The 
# algorithm can also be used for bond percolation, but this code is for site 
# percolation. 
#
# There are essentially three steps to the algorithm:
# 1) For every site in the model, find/define the nearest neighbours.
# 2) Draw a single sample uniformly from all site permutations.
# 3) Perform union-find (using root finding) method to find the big component
#
# This algorithm can be used to estimate statistics for a fixed number, say n, 
# of occupied sites. But typically such a (discrete) percolation model is 
# studied in relation to a parameter such as the probability, say p, of an 
# occupied site. It is not implemented in this code, but this leads to an 
# additional step:
# 4) Collect some statistic for every fixed number of occupied sites. This
# statistic, say Q_n, is a conditional statistic, being conditioned on the 
# number of occupied sites. To find the statistic as a function of the 
# probability p, the aforementioned (conditional) statistics are then averaged 
# (or convolved) with respect to the binomial probability. This 
# statistic, say Q(p), is given by equation (2) in the paper[1].
#
# Information on this algorithm can also be found in the book by
# Newman [Section 16.5, 2].
