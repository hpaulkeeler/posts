% Simulates a site percolation model on a square lattice embedded in a 
% torus by using an algorithm proposed in a paper by Newman and Ziff[1].
% The algorithm can also be used for bond percolation, but this code is for
% site percolation.
%
% There are essentially three steps to the algorithm:
% 1) For every site in the model, find/define the nearest neighbours.
% 2) Draw a single sample uniformly from all site permutations.
% 3) Perform union-find (using root finding) method to find the big component
%
% This algorithm can be used to estimate statistics for a fixed number, say
% n, of occupied sites. But typically such a (discrete) percolation model is
% studied in relation to a parameter such as the probability, say p, of an
% occupied site. It is not implemented in this code, but this leads to an
% additional step:
% 4) Collect some statistic for every fixed number of occupied sites. This
% statistic, say Q_n, is a conditional statistic, being conditioned on the 
% number of occupied sites. To find the statistic as a function of the 
% probability p, the aforementioned (conditional) statistics are then 
% averaged (or convolved) with respect to the binomial probability. This 
% statistic, say Q(p), is given by equation (2) in the paper[1].
%
% Information on this algorithm can also be found in the book by
% Newman [Section 16.5, 2].
