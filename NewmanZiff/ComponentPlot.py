# This file plots a site percolation model of a bounded square lattice on 
# a torus. Unoccupied sites are grey disks, whereas occupied sites are 
# coloured disks. Two or more sites of the same colour indicates them 
# belonging to the same component, where their shared colour is that of the 
# root site. For the colouring, the plotting function sets the seed of 
# NumPy's pseudo-random number generator. 
#
# The main input variable is the array arrPointer, which encodes
# information of the occupied and occupied sites, as well as the root sites 
# of componenets formed from the adjacent sites being occupied. The other 
# input parameter is valueEmpty, which indicates that a site is unoccupied. 
# Note that valueEmpty needs to be greater than the (negative) length of 
# the array arrPointer.

# The way that the array arrPointer stores encodes percolation information 
# was originally used in the C code presented in the appendix of the 
# paper[1] by Newman Ziff. More specfically, in the Appendix of the paper, 
# you'll find this explanation:
#
# "The array arrPointer serves triple duty: for nonroot occupied sites it 
# contains the label for the site’s parent in the tree (the ‘‘pointer’’); 
# root sites are recognized by a negative value of arrPointer, and that 
# value is equal to minus the size of the cluster; for unoccupied sites 
# arrPointer takes the value valueEmpty."
#
# Note: In the code here, I have changed the variables names in the origina 
# C code from ptr and EMPTY to arrPointer and valueEmpty, respectively.
